"BankyPig" plot options:

NOTE: Main character will most definetively be cooked potato (in pixel art 32x32 as whole game will be)

I: 
The plot of the game would be based on the main character trying to get back to kitchen/restaurant. Main character will oppose other food that
was also trashed(lol), the bosses could be actualy people (on the way back to the place) and on the end the player would fight the cook.


II:
The character would be moved out as trashy food to the toilet, and the cooked potato would wake up in sewers fighting (zoomie/poisoned) food,
after finishing boss probably some guy at sewers as boss or the mutated food boss. The character could get some poisoned food(?) weapon from
the boss/ before getting to the boss and could at the end fight the Cook or some restaurant guy

III:
The game would take place in the kitchen/ forgotten restaurant where good food would fight back rotten/poisoned/zombie-themed food,
the main plot point could be to bring back the people or to make the restaurant work again orrr now that I think about it, the food
could fight people that could be willing to take the restaurant back after the restaurant'd be clean up and all
