# BankyPig
#(Dev name) Piggy Bank - 2D Zelda like game in pixel art style 
#Game could be inspired on the game Turnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion
#Main story should be easy, like in the "big bad guy" games like the mentioned above game or Zelda games (mainly 2D ones) or a bit
#like a Mario Games I guess.
#Further on that topic, I think the enemies should be founded more in something like bases, where the all or most of the enemies try
#to attack a player at once and some smaller fights in between the enemies.
#-Random Thought-> I can make some enemies or characters from loona girls' animals (iPigus will know what the hell does he mean)
#hmm more on that thought the enemies could drop their outfits for some locations, so the player can dissguise themself
#Main Plot
#In some less advanced world of animals, the main character (pig)(probably living in the world of pigs which would be in the center
#of the other worlds) would work in a bank, and one day something happens (idk what can be something silly) to the money
#[brief thought, that big bad guys could take the money, but it'd happen in such silly way other peeps wouldn't belive the main character]
#in the bank and it causes very bad things to happen, the world of pigs collapses (maybe some other too). All of this causes the main character 
#to leave it's world and they would try to regain their lost money, but to achive that the character would need to go by all the worlds to 
#gain certain abilities (probably will be tied to some items).
#idk what to think about it, but I have written all of this lol
#anyway, the characters would look like simplified animals in rounded form.
#the main attacks would be based on the meelee battles, but there could be some weapons like bows or something, but not too crutial
#(outside of the bosses ofc)
